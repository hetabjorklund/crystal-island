# Crystal Island

Crystal Island is a first-person 3D game where your goal is to collect all the crystals hidden around the island.

Start the game by opening the *Crystal Island.exe* file. Don't move the .exe file from the folder - there are hidden files included in the folder that are required for the .exe file to work.

# How to play
* Press any key to continue on to the game or press ESC to quit.
* Set your direction with the mouse.
* Move forward, backward, left, and right with the arrow keys, jump with the space bar.
* Collect a crystal by walking towards it. Try to collect all the crystals!
* Avoid the water: the player dies and the game ends if the player goes underwater.
* There is no time limit or time bonus; you can just wander around the island and listen to the crickets if you wish.
